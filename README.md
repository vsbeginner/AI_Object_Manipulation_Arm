# AI-Based Vision-Controlled Robotic Arm for Selective Object Manipulation
AI-powered vision-controlled robotic arm capable of real-time object detection, classification, and selective pick-and-place manipulation using computer vision and motion planning. The system integrates deep learning-based perception with precise robotic control to autonomously identify and handle objects in dynamic environments. An intelligent robotic system that integrates **computer vision, deep learning, and embedded systems** to enable **real-time object detection and autonomous pick-and-place operations**.

This project demonstrates an end-to-end pipeline where visual input is processed using AI models, translated into spatial coordinates, and executed through a robotic arm for precise object manipulation.

## Project Overview

Traditional robotic systems rely on predefined instructions and lack adaptability to dynamic environments.

This project solves that limitation by introducing:

* Real-time object detection using AI
* Intelligent selection of target objects
* Automatic coordinate mapping
* Autonomous robotic arm movement

The system bridges the gap between **perception (vision)** and **action (robotics)**.

---

## Problem Statement

Conventional robotic arms:

* Cannot identify objects autonomously
* Require manual programming for each task
* Lack flexibility in dynamic environments

This project addresses these issues by creating a **vision-guided robotic system** capable of making decisions based on real-time visual input.

---

##  Solution Approach

The system is divided into multiple stages:

1.  Capture live video using camera
2.  Detect objects using YOLOv8
3.  Filter selected objects (selective detection)
4.  Extract object coordinates
5.  Map image coordinates to real-world space
6.  Send commands to Arduino-controlled robotic arm

###  Pipeline Flow

```
Camera → Object Detection → Selective Filtering → Coordinate Extraction → Mapping → Robotic Arm Execution
```
